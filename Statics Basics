Statics

Population(N) : Dataset 
Sample(n): Subset of Population

Variable: Variable is a property that can take on multiple/many values.
		 Types:
				1.Quantative/Numerical:
				2.Qualitative/Categorical:
We can classify data into two main ways:
1. Based on its type.
1.Numerical Data:
				It describes numbers.
				Example: Age: The age of individuals, such as 25, 40, or 65.
			It is divided into two subset:
					1.Descrete: Can be counted in a finite matter such as : No of children's.
					  Examples include the number of siblings a person has, the count of cars in a parking lot, or the number of students in a class and whole number.
					2.Continous:Cannot be counted infinite data Such as: Size of universe Or Body Weight
					  Examples include height, weight, temperature, or time and . 
2.Categorical Data:
				It describe category or groups. 
				Example: Car Brands and Yes and No Question such as :Are you 18 Plus
						 Marital Status: Categories like "single," "married," "divorced," or "widowed."
2.Based on its measurement level.
			Levels of measurement :
				1.Quantative:
					1. Interval : It does not have true zero.
					2. Ration : It has a true zero.
				2.Qualitative: 
					1. Nominal: Numbers that cannot be ordered.
					   Example:  gender (e.g., male, female), eye color (e.g., blue, brown, green), or country of residence (e.g., USA, Canada, UK). 
					2. Ordinal: It can be ordered.
					   Example:  ratings (e.g., 1 star, 2 stars, 3 stars) or educational levels.

		Numerical Visualization : 
							One of the most popular graph used to represent numerical data is histogram.


Measure of Central Tendency:
							
			Central Tendency:
				Central tendency refers to measure used to determine the "Centre" of the distribution of data.
					1.Mean(Average): Mean is a average.
						µ(MU): Population Mean 
							µ=(1+2+3+4)/N(Size of population data)
							x̄(X Bar): Sample Mean
							x̄:(1+2+3+4)/n(Size of sample data)
					2.Median: Mid value is called median.
						To resolve this we can follow these steps:
							1. Sort all the elements or numbers.
							2. Find the central element :
								When finding central element we will find two types of size of the data.
									1.Odd: In this case we can easily central element 
									   Example: Suppose We have 7 elements then 4 element will be the central element.
									2.Even: In this case we will have 2 central element 
									   Example:In this case to find the median of this type of data we will find average of both elements and the averatge will be the mmedian.										
					3.Mode: Most frequent element or most common element.
			Use Case:
				Outliers: Median
				Categorical feature: Mode
				

Measure of Dispersion:
			Measurement of the dispersion of a set of data points around its mean value.
			
			Variance:
				Population Variance(σ**2): σ**2=(Xi-µ)**2/N
				Sample Variance(s**2): s**2=(Xi-x̄)**2/n-1					Note:(N-1) is called Bessel's correction or Degree of freedom.
			Standard Deviation:
				Population Standard Deviation: 
					Root of Population Variance
				Sample Standard Deviation:
					Root of Sample Variance
		Covariance:
			It is helping us to quantify the relationship between random variable in a particular dataset.
			Covariance is a measure of the joint variability of two variables.
			A positive covariance means that the two variables move together.
			➢ A covariance of 0 means that the two variables are independent.
			➢ A negative covariance means that the two variables move in opposite directions.
			➢ Covariance can take on values from -∞ to +∞ . This is a problem as it is very hard to put such numbers into perspective.

Percentiles And Quartiles:
		A percentile is a value below which a certain percentage of observation lie.
		A Quartile(Q) is Quant.
		Quartiles(Q)=(Percentile/100)*n+1=Index(This formulae will give the index value of the Q)
		25% 	1 Quartile
		75%		3 Quartile
		IQR : Q3-Q1
To Find the outlier:
	IQR:
		1.Sort the Data
		2.Calculate Q1(25%) and Q3(75%)
		3.IQR(Q3-Q1) 
		4.Find the lower fence
		5.Find the higher fence
	Five number summary and box Plot:
		1: Minimum
		2: First Quartile
		3: Median
		4: Third Quartile
		5: Maximum
	Lower Fence:Q1-1.5(IQR)
	Higher Fence:Q3+1.5(IQR)
	Note: The value which lie the outside of the lower fence and higher fence value that is outlier.
	Outliers: A value different from entire distribution.

Normal Distribution: It follows the bell curve
Gaussian Distribution:
The Normal distribution is also known as Gaussian
distribution or the Bell curve. It is one of the most
common distributions due to the following reasons:
• It approximates a wide variety of random variables
• Distributions of sample means with large enough
samples sizes could be approximated to normal
• All computable statistics are elegant
• Heavily used in regression analysis
• Good track record
Examples:
• Biology. Most biological measures are normally
distributed, such as: height; length of arms, legs,
nails; blood pressure; thickness of tree barks, etc.
• IQ tests
• Stock market information
}
Central Limit Theorem: The central limit theorem states that whenever a random sample of size n is taken from any distribution with mean and variance, then the sample mean will be approximately a normal distribution with mean and variance. The larger the value of the sample size, the better the approximation of the normal.
		It states that no matter the underlying distribution of the
		dataset, the sampling distribution of the means would approximate a normal distribution. Moreover, the mean of the sampling
		distribution would be equal to the mean of the original distribution and the variance would be n times smaller, where n is the size of the
		samples. The CLT applies whenever we have a sum or an average of many variables (e.g. sum of rolled numbers when rolling dice).
Log Normal Distribution: The log-normal distribution is a right skewed continuous probability distribution, meaning it has a long tail towards the right. It is used for modelling various natural phenomena such as income distributions, the length of chess games or the time to repair a maintainable system and more.

Power Law Distribution: An example power-law graph that demonstrates ranking of popularity. To the right is the long tail, and to the left are the few that dominate (also known as the 80–20 rule).
						We Can also convert power law distribution to normal distribution by using Box Cox Transformation.

Pareto Distribution: It is example of power law distribution and this distribution is Non-Gaussian Distribution.

Hypothesis Testing: Hypothesis Testing is a type of statistical analysis in which you put your assumptions about a population parameter to the test. It is used to estimate the relationship between 2 statistical variables

Null hypothesis (H0):
				The null hypothesis is the hypothesis to be tested.
				It is the status-quo. Everything which was believed until now
				that we are contesting with our test.
				The concept of the null is similar to: innocent until proven
				guilty. We assume innocence until we have enough evidence
				to prove that a suspect is guilty.
Alternative hypothesis (H1 or HA):
				The alternative hypothesis is the change or innovation that is
				contesting the status-quo.
				Usually the alternative is our own opinion. The idea is the
				following:
				If the null is the status-quo (i.e., what is generally believed),
				then the act of performing a test, shows we have doubts
				about the truthfulness of the null. More often than not the
				researcher’s opinion is contained in the alternative hypothesis.
